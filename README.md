# 🚀 agentic-cicd: Automate GitLab CI/CD with Natural Language + AI

> “Automate your GitLab CI/CD workflows using natural language — powered by AI and Google Cloud.”

---

## ✨ Overview

**`agentic-cicd`** is an intelligent DevOps agent that allows users to automate complex GitLab CI/CD workflows simply by describing what they want in natural language.

It bridges **natural language commands** and **real infrastructure changes** by using an AI-driven **multi-agent system** that understands, generates, pushes, and monitors CI/CD pipelines on **GitLab**.

Whether you're a developer looking to set up a CI/CD pipeline or an ops engineer handling deployments — this tool simplifies GitLab automation through **LLMs + agents + MCP tool servers.**

## 🧠 Key Features

* 🔐 **GitLab OAuth Integration** – Connect your GitLab account securely.

* 💬 **Natural Language Input** – Describe what you want, like:

  ```
  Set up CI to run tests on push and deploy to GKE when main branch is updated.
  ```

* 🤖 **Multi-Agent AI Engine** – Understands the request and plans accordingly.

* ⚙️ **Pipeline & Infra Generation** – Generates `.gitlab-ci.yml`, Dockerfile, Terraform, Helm config, etc.

* ↻ **Push + Merge Request** – Pushes the generated files to your GitLab repo and opens an MR.

* 🔍 **Pipeline Monitoring** – Optionally track status of the build, test, and deployment stages.

* 🧹 **MCP Server/Client Architecture** – Modular tool abstraction to interface with GitLab API via agents.

## 🧠 Multi-Agent Architecture – LangGraphJS Supervisor Pattern

This project follows the [LangGraphJS Multi-Agent Supervisor Pattern](https://js.langgraph.dev/guides/multi-agent/) to automate GitLab CI/CD workflows using natural language commands.

---

### 🧑‍⚖️ 1. **Supervisor Agent**

- The central decision-maker.
- Receives **natural language input** from the user.
- Maintains **shared memory** and execution state across agents.
- Dynamically delegates to sub-agents using a **graph-based control flow**.

---

### 🔄 Agent Workflow Graph

The Supervisor uses LangGraph to define a **directed graph of agents**, where edges represent conditional flows based on task results.

---

### 🤖 Sub-Agents

Each agent handles a distinct responsibility within the pipeline.

---

### 🧭 `PlanAgent`

> _“Understand what needs to be done.”_

- Parses user intent and decomposes it into logical subtasks.
- Understands GitLab CI/CD terminology and translates user commands accordingly.
- Outputs a plan with goals such as:
  - Generate `.gitlab-ci.yml`
  - Create `Dockerfile`
  - Define cloud deployment strategy (e.g., GKE)

---

### 🧑‍💻 `CodeAgent`

> _“Write the code/configuration needed.”_

- Converts the structured plan into CI/CD artifacts such as:
  - `.gitlab-ci.yml`
  - `Dockerfile`
  - `Terraform` / `Helm` configurations
- Adapts generation based on selected cloud providers (GCP, AWS, etc.)
- Can scaffold standard GitLab CI templates dynamically.

---

### 🧪 `TestAgent`

> _“Validate the configuration before use.”_

- Runs tests on generated configuration to ensure correctness.
- Performs:
  - YAML linting / CI syntax validation
  - Dry-run of GitLab CI if applicable
  - Optional LLM-assisted analysis of pipeline logic

---

### 💬 `ChatAgent`

> _“Explain what’s happening or answer user queries.”_

- Maintains conversation with the user.
- Can answer questions like:
  - "What is this pipeline doing?"
  - "Why did my build fail?"
- Pushes updates about:
  - MR creation
  - Pipeline execution
  - Deployment status
- Can re-prompt for missing details if required

---

## 🔧 GitLab MCP Tool Server (Tool Use via API)

Agents like `CodeAgent` and `ChatAgent` interact with GitLab via a **dedicated Tool Server** (GitLab MCP Server).

### 🛠 MCP GitLab Tool Server

- A REST API wrapper around GitLab’s official APIs.
- Allows fine-grained agent control over GitLab actions like:
  - Getting project info
  - Creating branches/commits
  - Listing and triggering pipelines
  - Monitoring job statuses
  - Opening Merge Requests

---

### 🤝 MCP Client

- Each agent uses an **MCP Client** to communicate with the Tool Server.
- Benefits:
  - Keeps logic clean and separated from direct API calls.
  - Enables observability, tracing, and debugging of agent decisions.
  - Makes actions reversible and replicable.

---

## 🔄 Feedback Loop

1. **User Input**  
   > “Set up CI to run tests on push and deploy to GKE when main is updated.”

2. **Supervisor Flow**
   - `PlanAgent` → Understands the request and breaks into subgoals.
   - `CodeAgent` → Generates `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `Dockerfile`, etc.
   - `TestAgent` → Validates the generated files.
   - `GitLab MCP Server` → Applies the changes via GitLab API (opens MR).
   - `ChatAgent` → Informs the user and monitors progress.

3. **Pipeline Execution**
   - GitLab CI is triggered.
   - Status is periodically updated to the user.

---

## ✅ Why LangGraphJS?

- **Structured Reasoning**  
  Flow is modeled as a directed graph for better traceability and control.

- **Shared Memory Across Agents**  
  All agents work with a centralized state context.

- **Retries and Fallbacks**  
  Automatically retry failed tasks or re-ask user when needed.

- **Plug-and-Play Agents**  
  Each agent is modular, testable, and can be extended independently.

---

> ✨ The result is a natural-language-driven GitLab CI/CD automation system powered by intelligent agents, tailored infrastructure, and real-time feedback – all orchestrated via LangGraph.


### 🔐 Authorization:

* Uses the user’s OAuth token to act on their behalf.
* Each API call is scoped by the GitLab OAuth access token.
